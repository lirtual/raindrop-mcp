# MCP Portal acceptance checklist

This checklist is the reusable acceptance contract for Portal-first remote MCP deployments in this workspace. Raindrop is the reference implementation; other MCP projects should preserve their own domain-specific authorization and safety controls while reusing these ingress checks.

## Trust boundaries

A Portal-first deployment has three distinct credential boundaries:

1. **Client identity** — handled by Cloudflare MCP Portal / Managed OAuth / Access.
2. **Origin identity** — a dedicated credential used only from Portal to the MCP Worker, normally `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_ORIGIN_TOKEN>`.
3. **Business API identity** — the credential the MCP Worker uses with its real upstream service.

Never reuse one credential across these boundaries. In particular, never forward the client OAuth bearer token to the business API and never store the business API credential in MCP Portal as the origin credential.

## Pre-cutover checks

- [ ] The MCP Worker exposes a standards-based `/mcp` endpoint reachable by Cloudflare MCP Portal.
- [ ] Production `workers.dev` and Preview URL exposure are disabled where a custom Worker hostname is used.
- [ ] `/mcp` fails closed when the origin credential is missing or invalid.
- [ ] A valid origin credential reaches the MCP transport.
- [ ] The origin credential is removed or isolated before domain tools/business logic can observe it.
- [ ] The business API credential is configured independently from the origin credential.
- [ ] Domain authorization, read-only mode, path allowlists, destructive-operation guards, and other service-specific safety controls remain enforced by the MCP Worker/upstream service.
- [ ] Logs and error responses do not expose client OAuth tokens, origin credentials, or business API credentials.

## Portal checks

- [ ] The upstream MCP server is registered in Cloudflare MCP Portal using the Worker `/mcp` URL.
- [ ] Portal upstream authentication uses the dedicated origin credential, not the business API credential.
- [ ] Managed OAuth / Access policy permits only the intended user or account.
- [ ] The MCP client is configured with the **Portal URL**, not the raw Worker origin URL.
- [ ] Portal discovers the server successfully.
- [ ] Portal enumerates the expected tool surface.

## Functional smoke checks

Run these in order and stop on the first failure:

1. Confirm an unauthenticated direct `/mcp` request is rejected.
2. Confirm an authenticated direct `/mcp` request reaches the MCP transport.
3. Confirm Portal discovery succeeds.
4. Confirm the MCP client can enumerate tools through Portal.
5. Execute one representative read-only tool and verify the upstream result.
6. If the service has write tools, execute one bounded, reversible write operation only after the read path is proven.
7. Confirm destructive/read-only annotations and runtime safety controls still match the service contract.
8. Inspect application logs and confirm no secret values were emitted.

## Evidence requirement

Treat the checklist above as an operational gate, not as documentation-only acceptance. Record the date, deployed origin, Portal name, representative read/write tools, and secret-redaction result in the migration ticket before declaring a service cut over. Code and CI can prove fail-closed behavior and credential separation, but they do not substitute for live Portal discovery and tool execution.

## Rollback requirement

Before production cutover, document how to restore the previous ingress without changing business-service state or rotating unrelated business credentials. Rollback should affect only the ingress/authentication layer unless a service-specific incident requires otherwise.

## Gateway exception rule

`cloudflare_gateway` is not part of the normal Portal-first path. Insert it only when a concrete Cloudflare MCP Portal capability gap has been demonstrated, such as a required path rewrite or body/response transformation that Portal cannot express. The exception must document the exact missing capability and must not collapse client, origin, and business credentials into one token.

## Raindrop reference result

Raindrop's expected reference path is:

```text
MCP client
  -> Cloudflare MCP Portal + Managed OAuth
  -> Authorization: Bearer <MCP_ORIGIN_TOKEN>
  -> raindrop-mcp Worker /mcp
  -> RAINDROP_ACCESS_TOKEN
  -> Raindrop.io API
```

The detailed Raindrop deployment procedure remains in `docs/cloudflare-mcp-portal.md`.
